## Installation
We are using the SUMO platform, installation instructions for SUMO can be found at https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing.html

having SUMO installed and the SUMO_HOME environment variable set correct is required to run the scripts. It is also required to have python3 installed together with the numpy package.

Note that you can set the SUMO_HOME path to `sumo` or `sumo-gui`, where the latter allows you to visually inspect what is happening during the simulation.

## Running the simulation
Run the simulation by calling the python file main.py
eg. python main.py

n.b. this assumes that `python` refers to the python 3 installation, else replace `python` with `python3` in the previous command.
